## 📖 Description
Cub3D is a 3D game engine project inspired by Wolfenstein 3D, designed for 42 students to demonstrate mastery of graphics programming, low-level rendering, and Unix system programming. The project focuses on building a minimalistic raycasting engine from scratch, implementing real-time rendering of 3D environments using C and the MiniLibX library.

The engine is intended as a learning tool for graphics, linear algebra, and game mechanics, emphasizing performance, accuracy, and structured code.
