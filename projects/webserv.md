## 📖 Description
Webserv is a project aimed at creating a fully functional HTTP/1.1 web server from scratch in C++. Developed as part of the 42 curriculum, it demonstrates mastery of low-level networking, server-side programming, and protocol implementation.

The server handles static and dynamic content, processes multiple client connections concurrently, and is designed to comply with the HTTP/1.1 standard. Webserv emphasizes robustness, performance, and proper resource management.
